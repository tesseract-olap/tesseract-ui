# Next.js demo for the tesseract-ui monorepo

This folder contains a minimal implementation for the components of the  tesseract-ui monorepo. It's intended to help with the development of the associated react components.

## Usage

Installing the dependencies of this monorepo should also install the dependencies for this app.

```bash
[./tesseract-ui] $ npm install
```

You can run the `dev` script at the root of the monorepo to run all demo apps at the same time, while it also monitors and recompiles upon changes in the dependencies.

```bash
[./tesseract-ui] $ npm run dev
```

Alternatively, if you just want to run this demo app, you can use the `dev` script on this folder

```bash
[./tesseract-ui/apps/nextjs13/] $ npm run dev
